# User Names Fix Summary

## Problem
- User names were not showing in member lists in GroupManager
- "Added by" column in the table was showing "Unknown User" instead of actual user names
- Inconsistent user data fetching between components

## Root Causes
1. **Wrong table reference**: Table.jsx was querying `users` table instead of `profiles` table
2. **Missing added_by field**: New expenses weren't populating the `added_by` column
3. **Inconsistent field names**: Using `name` instead of `full_name` from profiles table

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend Changes

#### App.js
- Added `added_by` field when creating new expenses
- Uses `user?.user_metadata?.name || user?.email?.split('@')[0] || 'Unknown'`

#### Table.jsx
- Fixed table reference from `users` to `profiles`
- Updated field names from `name` to `full_name`
- Enhanced "Added by" logic to prioritize `added_by` field
- Better fallback handling for unknown users

#### GroupManager.jsx
- Fixed field references to use `full_name` instead of `name`
- Updated admin name display logic
- Fixed avatar initial display logic

### 2. Database Changes

#### update_existing_expenses.sql
- Updates existing expenses to populate `added_by` field
- Uses profiles table to get proper user names
- Sets fallback for expenses without user data

### 3. Testing

#### test_user_names_fix.py
- Tests backend API health
- Tests expense parsing functionality
- Validates the fixes are working

## Implementation Steps

1. **Apply frontend changes** (✅ Done)
   - Updated App.js, Table.jsx, GroupManager.jsx

2. **Run database update** (⚠️ Required)
   ```sql
   -- Run this in Supabase SQL editor
   \i update_existing_expenses.sql
   ```

3. **Test the application**
   - Start backend: `cd backend && python main.py`
   - Start frontend: `npm start`
   - Add new expenses and verify "Added by" shows correct names
   - Check group members display correctly

## Expected Results

After applying these fixes:
- ✅ Group members will show actual names instead of "Unknown"
- ✅ "Added by" column will show who added each expense
- ✅ New expenses will automatically populate the `added_by` field
- ✅ Existing expenses will be updated with proper user names

## Files Modified

- `src/App.js` - Added `added_by` field to expense creation
- `src/components/Table.jsx` - Fixed user data fetching and display
- `src/components/GroupManager.jsx` - Fixed member name display
- `update_existing_expenses.sql` - Database update script
- `test_user_names_fix.py` - Testing script

## Next Steps

1. Run the SQL update script in Supabase
2. Test the application thoroughly
3. Verify both personal and group expense tracking works correctly
4. Check that new users joining groups display properly
